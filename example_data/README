Example data was generated as described in the manuscript (Generation of synthetic data, Methods).
The data includes 500 individuals, 1000 genes and SNPs, and 16 cell types.
The effect size added to all the genes was 4 for immune cell types (STHSC.150- and its children), and 1 for the rest of the cell types.
